# Summary

# Statement of need



# Applications 

NLMech was used for following applications:

* Numerical convergence of finite difference approximations for state based perdidynamic fracture
models [@jha2019numerical] 
* Complex fracture nucleation and evoluation with nonlocal elastodynamics [@lipton2019complex]
* Free damage propogation with memory [@lipton2018free] 
* Kinext relations and local energy balance for linear elastic fracture mechancis from a
nonlocal peridynamic model [@jha2020kinetic]

For a updated list of applications, we refer to corresponding [NLMech documentation](https://nonlocalmodels.github.io/publications/).
